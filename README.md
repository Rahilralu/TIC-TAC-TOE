# Mini Projects Collection üéØ

Welcome to my Mini Projects repository ‚Äî a collection of small, self-contained projects built to sharpen my skills in web development and Python game development. These projects are fun, functional, and help reinforce important programming concepts.

üïπÔ∏è **TIC-TAC-TOE**:  
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using **Python and Pygame**. It features a basic 2-player mode, graphical interface, and handles win/draw detection. This project helped me get hands-on experience with game loops, rendering, and event handling in Pygame.

‚úä **ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR**:  
This web-based game is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It lets players play against a random computer choice. I used DOM manipulation and logic handling to update the scores and game status dynamically.

üí° This repository is a growing collection of my learning journey. As I explore more technologies and frameworks, I will keep adding to this repo ‚Äî from fun logic games to web tools.

Feel free to explore the folders and try out the projects!
