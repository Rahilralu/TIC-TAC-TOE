# TIC-TAC-TOE
 
Tic-Tac-Toe in Pure Python (Console Version):

First, you build a simple console-based tic-tac-toe game.

No graphics or buttons — just text output like a basic grid (3x3) where players manually input their moves.

The focus here is to understand the core logic of:

Game board creation

Player moves

Win checking (rows, columns, diagonals)

Checking for a draw

Switching between "X" and "O"

Integrating with Pygame (Graphical Version):

After you’re confident with the console version, you upgrade it by adding a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Pygame.

In the Pygame version:

A window is created showing the 3x3 grid.

Players click on cells to place "X" or "O" — no typing anymore.

"X" and "O" are drawn on the screen based on mouse clicks.

Game detects win or draw, just like in the console version.

You may also add things like:

A "Restart" button

Displaying who wins

Basic animations or sounds
