<h1># TIC-TAC-TOE</h1>
 
<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe in Pure Python (Console Version):</h3>

•  First, you build a simple console-based tic-tac-toe game.

•No graphics or buttons — just text output like a basic grid (3x3) where players manually input their moves.

•The focus here is to understand the core logic of:

  •Game board creation

  •Player moves

  •Win checking (rows, columns, diagonals)

  •Checking for a draw

   •Switching between "X" and "O"

<h3>Integrating with Pygame (Graphical Version):</h3>

•After  confident with the console version, I upgrade it by adding a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Pygame.

•In the Pygame version:

   •A window is created showing the 3x3 grid.

   •Players click on cells to place "X" or "O" — no typing anymore.

   •"X" and "O" are drawn on the screen based on mouse clicks.

   •Game detects win or draw, just like in the console version.
